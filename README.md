# RTSZ driver for new Realtek SD card readers

Yet another attempt to port the OpenBSD RTSX driver to FreeBSD. But I intend to finish this one.

**This is a work in progress!!!** I am literally copy-pasting bits of the OpenBSD code and poking at them until they work. This might fry your laptop or eat your dog.

In order to make this committable, I am following the outline in [this email thread](https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-hackers/2018-April/052520.html).
